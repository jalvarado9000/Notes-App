# Notes-App
Note pad app using linked list data structure

This repository contains the implementation of a simple linked list in C++.

Requirements
This program requires a C++ compiler installed on your system.

Installation
To use this program, simply download the linked.h header file and include it in your C++ program using #include "linked.h".

Usage
The linked class provides the following public methods:

create_node(string val): creates a new node in the linked list with the given value.
node_print(): prints all nodes in the linked list.
node_save(): saves all nodes in the linked list to a file named "linked.txt".
insert_position(): moves the current node to a specific position in the linked list.
DeleteNode(): deletes a specific node from the linked list.
SpecialF(): prints a list of special commands that can be used in the program.
set_num(int num): sets the first number used in a range of nodes to delete.
get_num(): gets the first number used in a range of nodes to delete.
set_num2(int num2): sets the second number used in a range of nodes to delete.
get_num2(): gets the second number used in a range of nodes to delete.
get_counter(): gets the number of nodes in the linked list.
set_addLine(string a): sets the text to add to the previous line.
get_addLine(): gets the text to add to the previous line.
To use this class, create an instance of the linked class and call its methods as needed.
